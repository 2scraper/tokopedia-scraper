diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku` —
the identifier the README already tells people to diff on for price
monitoring and assortment tracking, but that nothing in this repo actually
computed.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old girls_clothing.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new girls_clothing.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one of the four scraper engines, kept
under a dated filename, diffed against the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url "$URL" --out "girls_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "girls_$(ls -t girls_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "girls_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new (delisted, or just
                   off this particular page/category run)
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different price,
                   original_price, discount_pct, currency or in_stock
  source_changed — sku present in both with a different price, but also a
                   different price_source: one run got the DOM-corrected
                   figure and the other the raw JSON-LD one, so the two are
                   not comparable on price. Reported separately because this
                   says something about our own two snapshots, not about the
                   site — and --fail-on-change deliberately ignores it.

A product this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.
