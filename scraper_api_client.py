tokopedia-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)
=================================================================

A fourth way to run this scraper. Unlike playwright_scraper.py /
puppeteer_scraper.py / selenium_scraper.py, this one manages **no browser and
no CDP session of its own**: it POSTs a URL to 2captcha's separate **Scraper
API** (https://scraper.2captcha.com — a different product from the Scraping
Browser API the other three reach through --cdp-endpoint), gets HTML back over
plain HTTPS, and feeds it to this project's product_parser.

Why you would want it: no Chromium to install, no CDP plumbing, runs from a
tiny container or a lambda.

WHAT THIS SITE NEEDS — READ THIS FIRST
--------------------------------------
Etsy is a BAD fit for a browserless path, and this client is here for
completeness rather than as a recommendation. Measured 2026-09-09: a
`tasks/sync` fetch of a search URL returned an upstream **HTTP 403** with a
797-byte DataDome shell. The Scraper API's own exit is a datacentre address,
and Etsy refuses those outright — see the README's access table.

It is kept because it costs nothing to keep, because the API can be pointed
at a Scraping Browser session with `--cdp-url` (which is the path that does
work), and because a browserless fetch is genuinely the right tool on other
sites in this family. If you are reading this because your run came back
empty: use `playwright_scraper.py --cdp-endpoint` instead.

What the request would need to succeed is a residential exit, and this API
does not take a proxy of its own.

Usage
-----
    # plain HTTP, no browser anywhere
    python3 scraper_api_client.py \
        --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" \
        --url "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade+mug"

    # routed through a Scraping Browser API session, which is one way to get
    # challenge on the way
    python3 scraper_api_client.py \
        --key "$TWOCAPTCHA_KEY" \
        --url "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade+mug" \
        --cdp-url "ws://user:pass@cb.2captcha.com:9222" \
        --wait-text 's-search-result' --timeout 90

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt
          (no playwright/selenium/pyppeteer needed for this engine)
